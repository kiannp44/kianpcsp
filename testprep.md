###Github Actions are Under the Notes of Each Topic.

_Dopamine:_ Allows us to feel pleasure.

# Efficient Computing (5.1 - 5.2)
* Efficient computing may remove dopamine and may make things more frustrating for the user. An example of this can be a telephone tree where most companies use to save money, time, and reduce hold times.

## Github Actions
*  Computing can have a lot of benefits that also drag along their own harmful effects. Long computing usage can lead to eye strain, dryness in the eyes, and just a lot of effects on your sight and vision. Computers could also lead to joint and nerve pain due to incorrect posture when sitting down. Long hours of sitting and typing can lead to things like carpal tunnel syndrome.  Computing can also lead to mental problems like depression. The lack of human interaction can make one very sad.
*  I think that long hours of computing could cause a lot of problems mentally and academically. Computing, especially gaming, could give someone a sort of dopamine that makes them forget about the things around them. When somebody becomes very absorbed in these types of things, it could lead to failure in school since your priority shifts from school, to gaming since it provides you with more dopamine.

_Digital Divide:_ The gulf between those who have a computing device and those who do not.

> An example of Digital Divide could be the fact that 90,000 school children in New Jersey did not have access to computers capable of distance learning. This creates a divide in where some students are able to learn and others are not. It's not their fault at all.

## Github Actions
* Someone could empower themselves in the digital world by interacting with people virtually or using their resources to the max potential. An example of this would be to text a friend about your questions on a homework assignment that was given to the both of you. In this example, you are using your resources to succeed, thus empowering you.
* Someone who is empowered can help somebody else who is not empowered by sharing their resources or knowledge. At Del Norte, you could lend your resources to somebody who needs help, or you can directly give them the help they need by using your empowering devices.
* Paper or Red Taping can be digital empowerment. You aren't really being taken away your right of knowledge, but you just have to spend more time getting around it or going through it. Examples of this at Del Norte could be the Internet block which can sometimes block useful sources. You are simply able to get around this by using a VPN.

# Computing Bias (5.3)

![](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/raw/master/static/assets/computerbias.webp)
* Computing bias is when a computer is bias on the user, this can either be intentional or unintentional. 
> An example of this is the HP tracking technology. When there was a white woman in front of the frame, the camera would follow her, but when a black man was in the frame, the computer would not detect him.

## Github Actions
* The owner of the computer jokingly says its intentional, but knows it is not. This may have happened due to the color of the person and maybe didn't detect the person at all. This can be harmful, but this is for sure not on purpose. It should be corrected. What I would do is I would test and make sure it is able to detect the outline of the person rather than the color.

# Crowdsourcing (5.4) 
![](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/raw/master/static/assets/crowdsourcing.jpeg)

* Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain information, and allows you to share that information.
* An example of crowdsourcing is Wikipedia which has information based on multiple sources.

## Github Actions
* A crowdsource idea that could be useful in our Del Norte community could be a type of social media type app where students share school resources with each other. For example, if someone was having trouble with their math homework, they could go on the app to see how some other students completed it. Teachers could input the work themselves or even students. 
* I think crowdsourcing would be the best and most useful project especially at a time when computers are used so frequently. Crowdsourcing can help out a lot of people especially at Del Norte.

## Github Actions
* I noticed that in relationship to this tech talk, the licenses on the Github almost all of them have GPL (General Public Licensing). They either state that in the name or have a shortened way of saying it. I noticed there is also an MIT license similar to the one stated in the tech talk.
* For my individual github page, I licensed it with the Apache License 2.0. I used this license because it stated that it was okay for private and public use and allowed for distribution which may be of use in this class.
