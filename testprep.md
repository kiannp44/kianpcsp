_Dopamine:_ Allows us to feel pleasure.

## Efficient Computing
* Efficient computing may remove dopamine and may make things more frustrating for the user. An example of this can be a telephone tree where most companies use to save money, time, and reduce hold times.

*  Computing can have a lot of benefits that also drag along their own harmful effects. Long computing usage can lead to eye strain, dryness in the eyes, and just a lot of effects on your sight and vision. Computers could also lead to joint and nerve pain due to incorrect posture when sitting down. Long hours of sitting and typing can lead to things like carpal tunnel syndrome.  Computing can also lead to mental problems like depression. The lack of human interaction can make one very sad.
*  I think that long hours of computing could cause a lot of problems mentally and academically. Computing, especially gaming, could give someone a sort of dopamine that makes them forget about the things around them. When somebody becomes very absorbed in these types of things, it could lead to failure in school since your priority shifts from school, to gaming since it provides you with more dopamine.
