_Dopamine:_ Allows us to feel pleasure.

## Efficient Computing
* Efficient computing may remove dopamine and may make things more frustrating for the user. An example of this can be a telephone tree where most companies use to save money, time, and reduce hold times.

*  Computing can have a lot of benefits that also drag along their own harmful effects. Long computing usage can lead to eye strain, dryness in the eyes, and just a lot of effects on your sight and vision. Computers could also lead to joint and nerve pain due to incorrect posture when sitting down. Long hours of sitting and typing can lead to things like carpal tunnel syndrome.  Computing can also lead to mental problems like depression. The lack of human interaction can make one very sad.
*  I think that long hours of computing could cause a lot of problems mentally and academically. Computing, especially gaming, could give someone a sort of dopamine that makes them forget about the things around them. When somebody becomes very absorbed in these types of things, it could lead to failure in school since your priority shifts from school, to gaming since it provides you with more dopamine.

_Digital Divide:_ The gulf between those who have a computing device and those who do not.

> An example of Digital Divide could be the fact that 90,000 school children in New Jersey did not have access to computers capable of distance learning. This creates a divide in where some students are able to learn and others are not. It's not their fault at all.

* Someone could empower themselves in the digital world by interacting with people virtually or using their resources to the max potential. An example of this would be to text a friend about your questions on a homework assignment that was given to the both of you. In this example, you are using your resources to succeed, thus empowering you.
* Someone who is empowered can help somebody else who is not empowered by sharing their resources or knowledge. At Del Norte, you could lend your resources to somebody who needs help, or you can directly give them the help they need by using your empowering devices.
* Paper or Red Taping can be digital empowerment. You aren't really being taken away your right of knowledge, but you just have to spend more time getting around it or going through it. Examples of this at Del Norte could be the Internet block which can sometimes block useful sources. You are simply able to get around this by using a VPN.
